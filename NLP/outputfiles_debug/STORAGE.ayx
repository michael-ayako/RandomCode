- - who invented computers?
  - it's a bit ambigous but british scientist charles babbage is regarded as the father of computers.
  - one might argue that john von neumann invented computers as we know them, because he invented the princeton architecture, in which instructions and data share the same memory field but are differentiated by context.
- - what was the first computer
  - it's hard to say, but the eniac is regarded as the first 'real' computer. it was developed at university of pennsylvania in 1946.
  - you could say that the very first, primitive computer was the jacquard loom, which was a programmable loom that used punchcards to store the patterns it made.  this made it a reprogrammable mechanical device.
